# The Camera Trap Project

## Information

This repository contains our group work for the study project. 
We applied OpenCV analytical CV for the first iteration and 
machine-learning CV (YOLOv8n) for the second iteration. As we 
do not want to share the images publicly here, they have to be
downloaded separately and provided. 

## Running the algorithms

Iteration I

Run <b>detect_sequences.py</b> after downloading and unzipping the badger and deer image folders in the same directory as the script.
The resulting animal sequences are stored in <b>all_sequences.txt</b>.
Run <b>locate_animaly.py</b> to detect and locate the animals sequence by sequence.

Iteration II

Run <b>bdd_predict.py</b> after providing images (badger, deer, hare or fox) to the BDD_test folder. The prediction output will be 
shown in <b>run/predict</b>. For information about our custom YOLOv8n model, view <b>run/train5</b>
